TryHackMe Lab: Pyramid of Pain

## Overview

This lab explores the **Pyramid of Pain**, a framework that helps defenders understand how impactful different types of threat intelligence indicators are when detected and blocked.

The higher up the pyramid, the harder it is for attackers to adapt â€” meaning better defense and greater disruption of their operations.

## Pyramid of Pain Summary

| Level | Indicator Type | Example | Difficulty for Attacker | Impact for Defender |
|-------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | Hash Values | MD5 hash of malware | Very easy to change | Low |
| 2 | IP Addresses | Known malicious IP | Easy to rotate | Lowâ€“Medium |
| 3 | Domain Names | phishing-login[.]com | Moderate effort | Medium |
| 4 | Network Artifacts | Unusual protocol patterns | Moderate | Medium |
| 5 | Host Artifacts | Registry changes, mutex names | Harder to mask | High |
| 6 | Tools | Mimikatz, Cobalt Strike | Hard to replace | High |
| 7 | Tactics, Techniques & Procedures | Lateral movement using PSExec | Very hard to change | Very High |

## Key Takeaways

- Not all indicators of compromise (IOCs) are equal in value.
- Defenders should aim to detect and respond to **TTPs** and **tools**, not just IPs and hashes.
- Behavioral-based detections are more powerful than static indicators alone.

## Tools Used

- TryHackMe Platform
- MITRE ATT&CK Framework (for reference and enrichment)
